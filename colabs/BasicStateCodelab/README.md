# State in Jetpack Compose
An app's "state" is any value that can change over time. This is a very broad definition and encompasses everything from a Room database to a variable in a class.

### Key Terms and Notes:
- State determines what is shown in the UI at any particular time.
- Any action that causes the modification of state is called an *"event"*
- State is. Events happen.
- Recompose: The process of updating the state on event click/trigger and redrawing/re-rendering the result(ie the new state) to the UI.

All Android apps display state to the user. A few examples of state in Android apps are:

- The most recent messages received in a chat app.
- The user's profile photo.
- The scroll position in a list of items.

This code lab explains the core concepts related to using State in Jetpack Compose.
- It shows you how the app's state determines what is displayed in the UI,
- How Compose updates the UI when state changes by working with different APIs,
- How to optimize the structure of our composable functions, and using ViewModels in a Compose world.

## Prerequisites
- Knowledge of Kotlin syntax.
- Basic understanding of Compose [you can start with the Jetpack Compose tutorial](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial).
- Basic understanding of Architecture Component's ViewModel.

## What you'll learn
- How to think about state and events in a Jetpack Compose UI.
- How Compose uses state to determine which elements to display on the screen.
- What state hoisting is.
- How stateful and stateless composable functions work.
- How Compose automatically tracks state with the State<T> API.
- How memory and internal state work in a composable function: using the remember and rememberSaveable APIs.
- How to work with lists and state: using the mutableStateListOf and toMutableStateList APIs.
- How to use ViewModel with Compose.




## What we'll build
You will implement a simple Wellness app:

### State and Event
- Events are inputs generated from outside or inside an application, such as:
    - The user interacting with the UI by, for example, pressing a button.
    - Other factors, such as sensors sending a new value, or network responses.
- While the state of the app offers a description of what to display in the UI, events are the mechanism through which the state changes, resulting in changes to the UI.

- Events notify a part of a program that something has happened. In all Android apps, there's a core UI update loop that goes like this:

- Event - An event is generated by the user or another part of the program.
- Update State - An event handler changes the state that is used by the UI.
- Display State - The UI is updated to display the new state.
